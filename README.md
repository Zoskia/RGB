# RedGreenBlue

A small training project focused on practicing authentication, authorization, and frontend-backend interaction using a .NET 8 Web API and Angular 19.

## 🔍 Overview

Users are divided into three groups: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**.  
Each user can view the entire grid but only interact with hexes of their own color — and only within their specific color spectrum.  
An **admin** user has full access to modify all hexes.

The frontend features a color-selectable **hexagon grid** built with the [Honeycomb Grid library](https://honeycomb-grid.netlify.app/), plus some custom JavaScript logic.
